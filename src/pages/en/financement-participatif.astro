          <p>
            We already financed the first phase through our own funds, solidarity lenders (Patricia, Joelle and Paul,
            Serge and Marie-Agnes), the Coopérative Oasis, and the Association des Pas-Sages.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also have the support of the Region, the Community of Communes, elected officials, and the mayor. “The
            tourism development of the eco-hamlet is essential for the territory.” — Community of Communes of the

          These achievements were built through self-construction with the help of dozens of people in participatory
          builds and the support of craftspeople. Phase 1 took place between April 2022 and June 2024.
