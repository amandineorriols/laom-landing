      <div class="space-y-4 text-lg font-light text-black/70 leading-relaxed">
        <p>Connection to self: a fast-paced way of life that fragments our identities and distances us from our deeper aspirations.</p>
        <p>Connection to others: a hyper-connected world where isolation and individualism are on the rise.</p>
        <p>
          Connection to nature: an economic model that exploits without restoring, putting at risk the ecosystems we
          depend on.

          Faced with these challenges, we need new forms of living and working that regenerate our relationships, our
          environments, and the way we create value.

          LAOM is designed as a space where the liquid economy and the regenerative economy meet, enabling each person
          to evolve freely while leaving a positive footprint on their environment.

          This manifesto lays the foundations of a clear commitment: to design spaces that nourish people and their
          environment, where innovation and sustainability are not compromises but fundamental pillars.
