        <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-light text-black mb-6">A collective and intergenerational living place</h2>
        <div class="space-y-5 text-lg font-light text-black/70 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            LAOM is first and foremost a collective living place, a place where we experiment with living well
            together, with respect and autonomy for everyone. Housing is shared between permanent residents and
            temporary visitors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shared spaces are designed (some still under construction) to facilitate moments of exchange.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our collective is intergenerational, from ages 2 to 69. We place special attention on the education of
            children, convinced that everything depends on how they grow up. By offering them a living environment
            where respect, connection to nature, cooperation, and care prevail, we prepare future generations to build
            a better world.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-light text-black mb-6">A learning farm with regenerative agriculture</h2>
        <div class="space-y-5 text-lg font-light text-black/70 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            We practice regenerative agriculture, a proactive approach that revitalizes ecosystems by enriching
            biodiversity and soil while preserving water resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            With only 60 harvests left before irreversible soil degradation, our commitment goes far beyond farming.
            It is an invitation to learn and grow with nature to ensure the continuity of our soils and, with them,
            humanity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through hands-on workshops and open awareness initiatives for everyone, children and adults alike, we are
            committed to sharing everything we learn and experiment with on this educational market garden farm.
          </p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-light text-black mb-6">Eco-built buildings</h2>
        <div class="space-y-5 text-lg font-light text-black/70 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            At the crossroads of modernity and nature, new buildings are designed according to eco-construction
            principles, using local, renewable, or recycled materials. Load-bearing straw building, raw earth floors,
            and earth plasters: we are experimenters in search of durability, comfort, and health while reducing
            ecological footprint.
          </p>
          <p>
            These constructions are not only places to live or stay; they also serve as educational models for
            sustainable building.

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-light text-black mb-6">A welcome space for courses and retreats</h2>
        <div class="space-y-5 text-lg font-light text-black/70 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            In this oasis of biodiversity, at the heart of the Grands Causses natural park, our welcome space offers
            an immersive experience to visitors who want to discover the beauty of the place and interact with the
            other dimensions of the project (regenerative agriculture, living together, eco-construction).
          </p>
          <p>
            Disconnect from an overly busy life, synchronize with the frequencies of nature, connect with your inner
            magic to share it with the world. Nourish yourself to nourish the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            We imagine LAOM as a place to discover and learn from the best practitioners in dance, yoga, MovNat, and
            all other arts of presence. In formats of 2 to 7 days, the courses and retreats are open to all humans on
            the path toward a life with more presence and awareness.

          Immersive experiences, micro-festivals, residencies, and co-livings
        </h2>
        <div class="space-y-5 text-lg font-light text-black/70 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            The immersive experiences we imagine are transformative for creators, entrepreneurs, leaders, and
            artists. In return, these inspired and transformed people will spread their positive energy and wisdom in
            their own communities, contributing to a global impact of well-being and harmony. It is the butterfly
            effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Micro-festivals are moments of celebration, learning, and inspiration. The first micro-festival will be
            the Festival de la Terre in the fall of 2024.

        <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-light text-black mb-6">Why "LAOM"</h2>
        <div class="space-y-5 text-lg font-light text-black/70 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            The name "LAOM" combines two important sounds: "LAM" and "OM". Together, they symbolize the balance
            between earth and the universe, representing a space where these dimensions meet to foster personal growth
            and collective evolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sound LAM is associated with the root chakra, linked to our fundamental needs for security and
            stability. It highlights the importance of having solid foundations and creating an environment that
            nourishes us.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sound OM is sacred in many traditions and is considered the primordial sound of the universe,
            encompassing the totality of existence. It symbolizes unity and connection with everything around us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, "LAOM" represents a space where the grounding and stability of the earth (LAM) meet the unity of the
            universe (OM). It is a place that fosters both material well-being and personal growth, a space where we
            can feel safe, connected to ourselves, to others, to nature, and to something greater.
