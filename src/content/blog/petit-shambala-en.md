Petit Shambala is our self-built « test » house at LAOM. This first building was a testing ground for the techniques and materials we later used on Grand Shambala: timber frame, wood fiber insulation, rammed earth floor, earth plasters.

*(To be completed: construction steps, technical choices, lessons and challenges.)*
