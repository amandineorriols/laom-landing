This video documents the construction of **Grand Shambala** at LAOM: an **850 m² load-bearing straw** building with two floors, built in just **3 months**. It covers the main phases — foundations, base walls, straw bale walls, framing, and the south facade — and how a collective build and eco-construction techniques make it possible to move fast while keeping a low-impact, reversible approach.

Grand Shambala is one of the flagship projects of our third place: a space for hosting and communal living designed to reduce its footprint and to learn by doing. If you want to know more about the place or take part in build projects, feel free to [contact us](/en/contact/).
