The restaurant space serves people staying at LAOM (temporary residents, retreat participants, guests), especially in summer. The greenhouse and the food garden support it: growing, harvesting and cooking on site are part of the project.

*(To be completed: design, greenhouse build, restaurant fit-out and link with the market garden.)*
